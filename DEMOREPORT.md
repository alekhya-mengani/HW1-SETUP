##### Q2: Job satisfaction and gender: Are women more satisfied than men at work?## 

Question Focus: Comparing job satisfaction levels between genders to see if women are more satisfied than men at work.

Why a Simple Bar Chart is Appropriate:

A simple bar chart is particularly suitable for comparing job satisfaction levels between genders due to its ability to facilitate direct comparisons of average or median values across a limited set of categories. The simplicity of a bar chart ensures that the focus remains on the key message: the difference in job satisfaction levels between genders. It provides a clear, immediate visual cue about which gender reports higher average satisfaction.


##### Q3: What is the minimum monthly rate for age group between 40 and 60 (trend analysis)?#

Question Focus: Identifying the minimum monthly rate for the age group between 40 and 60 and analyzing any trends.

Why a Line Plot is Appropriate:

 Line plots are ideal for illustrating trends and changes over a continuous variable, such as age in this case. By plotting the minimum monthly rate for each age within the specified range, the line plot clearly demonstrates how this rate varies with age, highlighting any upward or downward trends.This approach provides a clear, straightforward visualization that makes it easy to identify the ages at which the minimum monthly rate changes, offering insights into potential patterns or anomalies within the age group.

##### Q4: Which department-based employees receives lowest median hourly rate? ##

Question Focus: Identifying which department-based employees receive the lowest median hourly rate.

Why a Horizontal Bar Chart is Appropriate:

Horizontal bar charts are excellent for comparing values across different categories, especially when the category names are long or when there are many categories to compare. This makes it easier to read and interpret the differences in median hourly rates across departments.The sorted arrangement of departments based on their median hourly rates in a horizontal layout emphasizes the department with the lowest rate, directly answering the question.
